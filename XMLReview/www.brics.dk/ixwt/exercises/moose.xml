    Two gorgeous blonde biologists were in the field one fine summer
    day. While following a game trail, they came across a pair of
    tracks. &quot;Look! a pair of tracks&quot; The first blonde said while
    pointing to the ground.

    "Oh no," she said to the first, "Those are definitely moose
    tracks."  With this, they began to argue. In fact, they were still
    arguing when the train hit them.
